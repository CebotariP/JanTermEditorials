      Preparing for Technology in the UK
      <br><br>Sarah Mott & Tricia Cebotari 
      <br><br> As we begin to prepare to studying abroad, it's important to understand this different 
      culture, it's values, and news in order to best interact with the people we meet. In an effort to do that, we've
      investigated some of their most recent news & businesses, including our personal thoughts 
      on what we've read here.

      <br><br>“King Charles: What sort of monarch has he been in his first year?” 
      <br><br>A year ago, our classrooms filled with the news that the Queen had died. 
      As the report permeated throughout our campus, I saw a glimpse of the impact her death 
      had on American culture, and it caused me to wonder how it impacted Brittan. Therefore, 
      when I saw an article on the BBC website covering what kind of ruler King Charles has been, 
      I decided to investigate. A few main things stood out to me from the article. The first notable 
      point is that it appears King Charles has remained relatively unswerving from the traditions and 
      political stances of his mother. Rather than commit to any new policies about climate change or 
      international relations, like he has mentioned in the past, he has consistently kept a lower 
      profile. While some criticize him for this approach, most analysts see this as a good strategic 
      approach to maintain stability following the aftermath of the Queen’s death. King Charles’ 
      continuation of the style of the previous monarch allowed politics and people’s mentality 
      toward the monarchy to remain relatively unchanged over the past year. The second concept that 
      stood out is that, although King Charles has stayed generally in good favor with Britons, the 
      people do not seem as loyal to the idea of a monarchy as they once did. According to some of the 
      polls cited in the article, a growing percentage of the young population, those in their late 
      teens and early twenties, think that their country would be better off without a monarchy. 
      Nevertheless, the majority of Britons still think that King Charles has ruled well overall and 
      remain supportive of the monarchy. The question remains though, as King Charles is approaching 
      seventy-five, what will happen to the monarchy when he is succeeded after a period of only a 
      couple decades at most. Coming out of reading this article I will be curious to see the evolution 
      of how the public views the monarchy and whether, within my lifetime, the monarchy is dissolved.

      <br><br>"Mayor's policing office staff to strike over pay"
      <br><br>According to the University of College London, “Despite being the richest city in the UK, 
      London has the highest rate of poverty of any region in England, with more than a quarter (27%) 
      of the capital’s residents living in poverty in 2021, after taking housing costs into account”. 
      A large reason behind this is the pandemic - it had widened inequalities in life expectancy 
      between the richest and poorest communities, as well as widened income inequalities. All of this 
      has led to a cost-of-living crisis in London and across England. This has affected government 
      workers, as displayed by an article from BBC on some staff planning to strike over pay. The 
      London Mayor’s Office for Police and Crime (MOPAC) staff are responsible for London’s regional 
      police and crime commission. They also oversee the financial scrutiny of the London Metropolitan 
      Police. On September 8, 2023, it was reported that about 100 staff from the London MOPAC will go 
      on strike on September 20-22 and 25-26. These staff members are also a part of the Public and 
      Commercial Services (PCS) union. The reason behind the strike is a dispute over a cost-of-living 
      payment. The union specifically spoke about how despite the workers receiving a 7% pay raise, 
      they were angry to not have received “a £1,500 one-off cost-of-living crisis payment offered to 
      civil servants”.  The expectation was that if they were experiencing the same cost-of-living 
      crisis as other government workers, and if other government workers were receiving this payment, 
      they should as well. This payment began in June for civil servants below senior grades after 
      strike action. When MOPAC mentioned that they would only provide the 7% pay increase, PCS members 
      decided to strike. The strike is meant to occur before any meetings about the cost-of-living 
      crisis. Senior leadership from MOPAC was feeling disappointed at the decision to strike. 
      The author of the article didn’t make a conclusion about the issue, wrapping up the piece 
      by reporting that MOPAC said its core business would be unaffected by these circumstances. 
      <br><br>A critique that could be made for MOPAC at this moment is the hypocrisy that is seen in 
      the government system. With the understanding that the population of London is undergoing a 
      cost-of-living crisis, the local government in London is giving out crisis payments to government 
      employees. MOPAC is an organization that is part of the government, as well as necessary for 
      local society to continue to operate. Treating MOPAC staff differently compared to other 
      government workers in terms of these crisis payments is both unequal and hypocritical. 
      MOPAC staff should be receiving the same crisis payment their colleagues are receiving in a 
      different agency/government organization. This strike is justified in regard to asking for 
      equal treatment and the fulfillment of an expectation and civil promise.
